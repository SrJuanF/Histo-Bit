# 🧬 Histo-Bit

**Decentralized, encrypted, and patient-centered medical records system powered by blockchain.**

---

## 🌍 Problem

Today, hospitals, insurers, and clinics hold full control over patients’ medical data.  
This creates critical issues:

- ❌ Limited portability between providers  
- ❌ Security risks and vulnerability to data breaches  
- ❌ Centralized dependency on siloed systems  
- ❌ Lack of patient autonomy over their own information  

Patients often cannot decide **who** accesses their records, **when**, or **for how long**—while still needing confidentiality of their health conditions.

---

## 💡 Our Vision

**Histo-Bit empowers patients to be the true owners of their medical records.**

- Patients decide who can view their data and for how long.  
- Medical records become **portable**, moving securely between providers.  
- Data is encrypted and stored on a **private Layer 1 blockchain**, ensuring confidentiality.  
- Patients can **monetize** anonymized statistics by sharing them (if they choose) with insurers, hospitals, or researchers.

---

## 👥 Actors and Roles

- **Patients** → Own their data; manage permissions (read/write/share).  
- **Doctors** → Validate and generate clinical information stored on-chain.  
- **Insurers** → Manage insured lists and serve as validator nodes in the network.  
- **Auditors** → Oversee activity, transactions, and compliance.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted before storage.  
- **Private L1 Blockchain**: Medical data stored as encrypted references/hashes, with large files (e.g., medical images) offloaded to **IPFS**.  
- **Advanced Cryptography**:  
  - Baby Jubjub curve  
  - Partial Homomorphic Encryption  
  - Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) → transactions validated without revealing private data  
- **Key Management**: Based on biometric proof of human identity/presence.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Access & Role Contract** → Defines patient, doctor, insurer, auditor permissions.  
- **Medical Records Contract** → Stores only encrypted references (IPFS).  
- **Transactional Contract** → Fully auditable log of access and modifications.  
- **Consent Management** → Patients decide *what* to share and *for how long*.  
- **Encrypted Token** → Manages identity and digital assets (eERC20).  

### Avalanche Integration
- Built on **Avalanche private L1 (permissioned blockchain)**  
- **Consensus**: Snowman++ → near-instant transaction finality, low latency  
- **EVM-Compatible VM** → Solidity contracts & Ethereum ecosystem integration  
- **Gas**: Native token, limited to internal network operations  

---

## 📱 Applications & UX

- **Patients** → Access medical history, control permissions, monetize statistics  
- **Doctors** → Validate and write clinical records  
- **Insurers** → Administrative dashboards and validator role  
- **Auditors** → Monitor user activities and compliance  

Web and mobile apps will deliver role-specific interfaces.  
**MVP focus** → Patient-friendly, intuitive flows.

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

### Stage 1
- Core smart contracts (access, storage, transactions)  
- Encryption logic & security tests (Hardhat)  
- Simulated data on IPFS + permission workflows UI  

### Stage 2
- Deploy Avalanche private blockchain  
- Validator and RPC nodes setup  
- Closed test environment  

### Stage 3
- Integrate audit layer  
- Permission control dashboards  
- ZKP-based privacy tests  

### Stage 4
- Network stress testing (multi-user scenarios)  
- Role simulation (patients, doctors, insurers, auditors)  
- Technical + executive documentation for public launch
